I started as a scientist but pretty soon realized that creating software to help others achieve their research goals is my main motivation.

From simple data analysis (geometrical relations) and image processing scripts, this lead me to develop a Python package for guiding Transmission EM image acquisition based on image features.
I always like to make powerful computational tools available to end users, so I developed some handy tools for accessing a compute cluster.

My most recent and biggest [project](https://git.embl.de/schorb/volumealign) so far is a dash-based WebUI for running an alignment pipeline for large volume image data on HPC hardware.
